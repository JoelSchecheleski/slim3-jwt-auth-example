# Slim3 jwt sample

This is an example of implementation of JWT authentication using Slim3. I have created this repo to be used in pair with
the [ionic-jwt-sample] (https://github.com/letsila/ionic2-jwt-sample) which contain the code used by the client to authenticate through.
You can get inspired by the code inside this repo to make your own implementation.
